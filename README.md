# ALX Listing App

ALX Listing App is a property listing platform inspired by Airbnb, built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. The goal is to provide a clean, responsive, and scalable foundation for building a modern property listing or rental application.

## Project Structure

- **components/**: Contains all reusable React components.
  - **common/**: Shared UI components like `Card` and `Button`.
- **interfaces/**: TypeScript interfaces for props and data models (e.g., `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`).
- **constants/**: Centralized constants such as API URLs, configuration, and UI text.
- **public/assets/**: Static assets (images, SVGs, etc.) used throughout the app.
- **pages/**: Next.js Pages Router for routing and API endpoints.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
	```bash
	npm install
	```
2. **Run the development server:**
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Goals

- Build a scalable, maintainable Airbnb-style listing page.
- Enforce type safety and code quality with TypeScript and ESLint.
- Use TailwindCSS for rapid, responsive UI development.
